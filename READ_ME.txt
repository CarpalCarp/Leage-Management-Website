This is a front-end view of a soccer league website. It's main purpose was to
create teams and players.

Look at the screenshots in the links folder which shows the links that work

The delete teams/players options do not work because this was only a pure front-end
website just for looks. I have one made in php and mysql and you can delete and add teams/players
on the list.

Also the video on the home page is purely a filler. I used to have a Youtube
embedded video but contents always change by the owner and so I put a video
of a cat as a filler.
